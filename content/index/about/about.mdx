import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm a web developer who mostly uses React and Gatsby. I started learning web development in 2017. I recieved my Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration from The University of Texas at Dallas in 2019. Subsequently I finished the Software Engineering Immersive program from General Assembly in 2020. 

I interned at Dell where I used Python to predict sales results, and I've worked other places as a web developer. 

Right now I'm seeking new and interesting web dev opportunities in small-midsize businesses. I'm mostly focused on the Austin and Toronto metro areas, but am open to other places!

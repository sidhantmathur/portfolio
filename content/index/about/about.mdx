I'm a web developer who mostly uses React and Gatsby. I started learning web development in 2017. I recieved my Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration from The University of Texas at Dallas. Subsequently I finished a Software Engineering Immersive program from General Assemebly. 

Right now I'm searching for web dev opportunities in small-midsize businesses in the Austin and Toronto metro areas. 

Check out some of my projects below.
